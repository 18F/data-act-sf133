## DATA Act SF 133


A handful of required DATA Act elements are found on the [Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SF-133)](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a11_current_year/s130.pdf).

This project examines the quarterly SF-133s published by OMB and matches them to the following DATA Act elements:
* Amount of budget authority appropriated
* Obligated amount
* Unobligated amount
* ~~Amount of other budgetary resources~~
* Outlay
